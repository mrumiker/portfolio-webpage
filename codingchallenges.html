    <h1 style="margin: 10px">Dirac Dice: an Advent of Code Challenge</h1>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>Games, alternate universes, quantum physics. These were some of the things I was thinking about in December of
        2021.</p>
      <p>This was puzzle #21 of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com" target="_blank">Advent of Code</a> - It‚Äôs a game:
        two players, a circular board with 10 spaces
        marked 1 - 10, and one three-sided die (an engineering marvel in itself!). On each turn, the player rolls the
        die three times and moves that
        many spaces. After those three moves, the player ends up on a numbered space and adds that space‚Äôs number to her
        total score. First player to 21 wins!</p>
      <p>Simple enough, but here‚Äôs the twist: these are special Dirac dice (named for quantum physicist <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac" target="_blank">Paul Dirac</a>) and
        each time the die is rolled, the universe splits into multiple copies, one for each possible roll of the die.
        The problem was, given any starting spaces for players 1 and 2, to figure out which player would win in more
        universes and exactly how many universes that would be.</p>
      <p>
        The challenge of this was to write a program that could handle this calculation, which would end up being in the
        hundreds of trillions. What I couldn‚Äôt do was simulate the game hundreds of trillions of times - my MacBook
        could not handle that amount of processing. So my task was to break the problem down and see how I could
        simplify it as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>One point of simplification is the fact that we are examining ALL possible scenarios, which takes the element
        of
        chance (and perhaps fun) out of the game. We can figure out that if you roll a three sided die three times, and
        create a universe for each possible outcome, there are 7 possible totals, with 3 being the lowest and 9 being
        the highest. Additionally, there is only one way to roll a 3 (three ones) and a 9 (three threes), so there‚Äôs
        only going to be one universe created for each of those. The in-between numbers have more possible combinations,
        with a 4 or 8 having 3 combos, 5 or 7 having 6 combos, and the most likely roll, 6, having 7 combos. This means
        that there will always be 27 universes created out of any turn in any particular universe, but only 7 different
        kinds of universes. Already, we are seeing that there is redundancy and predictability in this game that we can
        use to our advantage.</p>
      <p>Now what is a ‚Äúscenario‚Äù exactly? I thought about what would be the minimum amount of information I would need
        to describe the state of a game at any point. It‚Äôs something like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Player 1‚Äôs point total</li>
        <li>The space player 1 is on</li>
        <li>Player 2‚Äôs point total</li>
        <li>The space player 2 is on</li>
        <li>Whose turn it is</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That‚Äôs it! If you were playing the game, and you had to put it away and go save the universe or something, you
        could write down this info and be able to pick up right where you left off. Describing a game scenario this way,
        there are ‚Äúonly‚Äù 40,000 different possible game situations you can have at one time - a lot, but way less than
        900 trillion. So instead of simulating games, you can count scenarios.</p>
      <p>
        So I made a <a href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-objects/" target="_blank">JavaScript
          object</a> to keep count of each of those 40,000 possible game scenarios. At every turn, the
        die is rolled, we look at the old object and dump the new counts into the new object. When any of the scores go
        above 20, we add those totals to the winning player‚Äôs win count. Once all the games reach 21 points or higher,
        we‚Äôre done (this takes about 19 rounds).
      </p>
      <b>ü•Å <a href="https://github.com/mrumiker/aoc-2021/blob/main/day21/solutionB.js" target="_blank">My Solution</a>
        ü•Å</b>
      <p>I had a lot of fun doing Advent of Code this year, and learned a great deal about tricky things like recursion
        and scope of variables. I ended up with 39 out of 50 solved, and third place on my local leaderboard. This was
        the solution I was proudest of - it felt good to get an exact answer in the hundreds of trillions in under a
        quarter of a second.</p>
      <p>In my journey into coding I‚Äôve found that I enjoy these coding puzzles most of all - I like coming up with my
        own ways to solve these and working the old üß†. Thanks for reading!</p>
