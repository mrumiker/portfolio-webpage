    <h1>Meet App</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Meet App is a serverless, single page, progressive web application that gives users the inside track to the
      happenings in
      their city and around the world.</p>

    <p>Users can search events by city and limit the number of events displayed. The app features lightning-fast
      performance after it is loaded.</p>

    <p>Desktop users can enjoy <b>Data Visualization</b> of the distribution of events and topics, built with
      <b>ReCharts</b>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>The app was built with <b>React</b>, using the <b>test-driven development (TDD)</b> method. It uses <b>AWS</b> as
      its "serverless" server and gathers data from the <b>Google Calendar API</b>. </p>

    <p>I developed the app by writing Unit and Integration tests first, and then writing the App's code to pass the
      tests. While this was challenging, I learned a great deal about writing effective tests and asynchronous behavior.
    </p>

    <p>The app is continuously monitored by <b>Atatus</b>.</p>

    <p>This is a <b>Progressive Web Application (PWA)</b> that can run online or offline, and can be installed as a
      standalone app.</p>
    <p>I used <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b>in JavaScript to design colored Alerts that appear to help the
      user navigate the site. See if you can find all four alerts!</p>
    <br />
    <p>I came a long way as a programmer while creating Meet App. I feel more in command of React, having completed two
      React projects. Testing was a real challenge! I hope you enjoy exploring Meet App.</p>
